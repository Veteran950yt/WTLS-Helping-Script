# WTLS-Helping-Script
This is a small project which was made in Python to act like a chat bot. It reads the chat (or a file) and provides helpful information (which you can customize too!) when a certain keyword is matched,

# How it was made
It was made using the help of ChatGPT and some edits were needed which I did. The idea was mine, but I didn't know if it was possible in this game. So I asked ChatGPT and it provided me with the answers. Since college didn't teach me enough Python, I couldn't understand some lines like the multi-threading lines and a few more. This is why I needed to purchase a Python developer course on Udemy to learn the concepts and then later recreate this project only by using my knowledge, so I could implement some stuff I wanted (which is impossible by ChatGPT for some reason).
